## Overview
Two friends had a great time using the bikesharing service in New York City. They want to perform data analytics on the bikeshare business in New York City to gain insight. Using the the knowledge gained, they will decide whether it is feasible to start a bikesharing business in Des Moines before putting together a proposal for the investor. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to process raw data through jupyter notebook, and perform analysis in Tableau and visualize trends.

**Figure 1: The line graph shows that most bike rides are approximately 20 minutes long. Rides are rarely over 60 minutes long.**

**Figure 2: The line graph shows that males tend to use the Citibike more than females. However, regardless of the gender, the bike rides are 20 minutes long.**

**Figure 3: The heatmap shows that  peak hours usually tend be be between 6am-10am and 5pm-8pm during most weekdays except Wednesdays.There's also some traffic in the morning and afternoon (9am-7pm) during the weekends.**

**Figure 4: The heatmap recaptures data from figure 3. However, we see that there are way more male riders than female riders. The unknown riders (without profile information) does not have very clear trends, probably because there might not be enough riders.**

**Figure 5: The heatmap displays customers versus subscribers in terms of usage and gender. The heatmap displays that most of the data belongs to the subscribers given the color gradient.**

**Figure 6: The pie-chart displays that most users are subscribers versus random customers.**

**Figure 7: The bar graph shows which hour of the day people start using the Citibike ride and counts the number of users. We can see that the popular times are during the morning and during the evening, which is usually rush hour timeframes.*
## Summary

### *Further Research*
Further research needs to be done before anything is implemented. For example, a heatmap of traffic of NYC versus that of Des Moines will be healpful. NYC is very congested and busy, which makes biking a lot more convenient to get around. Des Moines in Iowa, although a decently-sized city, does that necessarily have as much traffic. Another visualization is bar graph of preliminary data about how many people will ride the bikes if implemented in Des Moines. It's important to consider how many of the potential customers are interested in using bikes to get around. 


### *Conclusions*
We can see that the majority of the users of Citibike in NYC are subscribers and males. Furthermore, the most popular times are during rush hour between Monday and Friday, with a general-spread during the day on the weekends. We also see that Citibike ehas more subscribers, who are loyal customers, rather than one-time use customers. From a general stand-point, the investors have a good idea on the demographic of the users and when they use them. However, the analysis needs more demographic information on Des Moines. The population in the two cities could be completely different. So while we have a lot of data on NYCF, we need more information on Des Moines.
